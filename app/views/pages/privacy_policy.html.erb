    <h4 class="bold mb-4">8. DATA BREACH</h4>
    <p class="responsive-text">A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when Foenix Coding Ltd believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Foenix Coding Ltd becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Foenix Coding Ltd will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
    <!-- 9 -->
    <h4 class="bold mb-4">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
    <p class="responsive-text">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>
