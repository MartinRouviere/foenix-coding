    box_coding_description: The most typical application is the coding of boxes. With the FX ONE Standard and FX ONE Plus no need for expensive labels anymore. Use the FX ONE printer for high resolution printing directly onto cartons, trays, sacks or other products on a production line to eliminate the need for costly pre-printed packaging or expensive labels. Short batch runs and customer requirements for personalised text, graphics and barcodes are easily achieved.
    product_coding_title: Product Coding
    product_coding_description: Typical applications are the coding of individual packaging like bottles, small boxes, drums, cans, jars, packs, bags, foil, etc. Most of our customers for product coding are typically companies looking for an alternative to the CIJ (Continuous Ink Jet). Price, simplicity and low maintenance are the motivation factors. In this market we always use the FX ONE Remote printer, a truly multifunctional printer for all industries including food, beverage, pharmaceutical and electronics. The FX ONE is also ideal for marking extrusions, printing on webbing and other industrial applications.

    first_section_sub_title: THE FX ONE PRINTERS REDUCE COST PER PRINT
    first_section_text_html: "Cost per print is determined by 3 factors: the purchasing price of the printer, the ink cost and the monthly maintenance cost. Foenix Coding has designed a simple ink jet printer with cost reductions as a priority.
                              The FX ONE inkjet printer has been developed with simplicity in mind and does not contain moving parts nor pumps nor valves. The ink feed is based on capillarity and gravity and there is no need for compressed air.
                              The control is mastered by 1 single PCB that is connected to the print head with 1 single data cable.
                              <br>
                              Thanks to the simplicity and the absence of moving parts, NO monthly or annual maintenance is required. By using much less components than others, the FX ONE printer has a very competitive purchase price.
                              The Xaar print-technology allows ink deposits as small as 40 pico litre per drop (that is 0.000000040ml), resulting in massive ink savings. Additionally every FX ONE printer has an ink saving mode that reduces the cost per print even more.
                              <br>
                              Besides the usual function like barcodes, counters, logos, date, time, shift etc the FX ONE printer comes with PC software and network connectivity as a standard.
                              <br>
                              Foenix Coding understands the Art of Simplicity and has created a simple and cost effective printer that is exactly suited to the customer specifications."
    inkjet_printer_title: How to choose an inkjet printer
    inkjet_printer_text_html: "We know choosing an inkjet printer is not easy. There are plenty of different technologies, manufacturers and models availble.
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             Each application has different requirements. You need first to understand well your application, this will save you a lot of time and disappointment.

                                The shutter-open-time can be as short as 5 seconds. This means that the shutter will be open for only 5 seconds, during the printing. Immediately after, it will close and protect the printhead against draft, humidity, dust and other contamination in the air."

                                A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a set of software functions that can be used by a third party developer to incorporate into their own applications. The Foenix DLL provides a set of functions that allows the FX ONE printer to be controlled via the FX APP application or Foenix Touch Controller.
                                The library makes the communication process to the printer much simpler for the developer as it takes care of the actual protocol used. The developer then uses a relatively simple mechanism to monitor printers, load messages and transmit data."

    fifth_section_sub_title: What is a DLL?
    fifth_section_text_one: A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a set of software functions that can be used by a third party developer to incorporate into their own applications. The Foenix DLL described here provides a set of functions that allows a FX ONE printer to be controlled via the FXPro application or Foenix Touch Controller. The library makes the communication process to the printer much simpler for the developer as it takes care of the actual protocol used. The developer then uses a relatively simple mechanism to montior printers, load messages and transmit data.
    fifth_section_title_two: How Does a DLL Work?

    first_section_title: FOENIX CODAPACK
    first_section_text: The Codapack printers all use replaceable pre-impregnated Plastic-Ink Rollers and interchangeable Baselock Type. They are easily mounted to print on either the top, bottom or side of a product. These printers are widely used where zero down time is a necessity and lowest print cost per product is required.
                        When only changing the code or best before date once a day or once a week, the Codapack printers are the best.
