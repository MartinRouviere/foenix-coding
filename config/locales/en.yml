    third_section_title: We focus on the importance of cost of ownership in industrial printing.
    third_section_text: Whether you are looking for an inkjet printer for case coding or product marking, the investment in printing is no longer just about the printer price. Consumables and maintenance have become the main factors to determine your cost of ownership.
    fourth_section_text_left: Thanks to the clever design, the Xaar piezo inkjet printers have a remarkably low ink usage and therefore offer a very low cost per print. These printers also allow you to code directly onto your carton or product eliminating the need for expensive label printers, labellers and labels.
    fourth_section_text_right: Foenix Coding offers a range of printers which are keeping down cost of ownership. We are driven by a zero maintenance philosophy for small character printing. We are also working hard to offer the most user friendly industrial printer. Foenix printers work with a simple Windows PC software with pictorial keys and/or a very evolved and intuitive Touch controller.

    fifth_section_sub_title: What is a DLL?
    fifth_section_text_one: A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a set of software functions that can be used by a third party developer to incorporate into their own applications. The Foenix DLL described here provides a set of functions that allows a FX ONE printer to be controlled via the FXPro application or Foenix Touch Controller. The library makes the communication process to the printer much simpler for the developer as it takes care of the actual protocol used. The developer then uses a relatively simple mechanism to montior printers, load messages and transmit data.
